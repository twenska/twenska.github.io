{: .notice}

For a few weeks or probably even months I am thinking about creating a blog. It's a good thing for documenting my own projects and thoughts about things. Maybe this even helps someone who wants to do similar things or it sparks a discussion where  I can learn something new...
But creating a blog is kind of a project in itself.


  1. Should you self-host it?
  2. Should you use a platform like Medium?
  3. What technology to use? What does this cost?
  4. Can you take your content to another place?

I have nearly zero knowledge of things like CMS or other web hosting stuff. So I was going on a google ride to find something that suited me. I first looked at things like Wordpress or Ghost. These platforms are great but bring some problems. If you self host it, you have to maintain a _complex_ system with dependencies and stuff. If you host this in their cloud offerings you are quickly spending 30 bucks per month.
Then I found Jekyll as a static site generator. This is pretty neat. Why should I have tons of dynamic stuff on my website, when the only thing I need is static content that doesnt look like garbage? Together with the Minimal Mistakes theme and Github Pages I still now nearly nothing about Jekyll or how this web frontend works, but still have this blog up and writing this first post as a test.

If this post is still up when you read this, I probably read a little bit more about this topic and gathered enough knowledge to create a basic blog that aligns with my standard of quality for such a thing. Else I will probably move to another platform/tech soon.

Cya soon!
